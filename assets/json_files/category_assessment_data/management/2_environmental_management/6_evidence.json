However, an EMS is not a prerequisite and, in smaller companies or projects, evidence could be minutes of meetings at which these issues, and the mechanisms to be used, are discussed and agreed. Appropriate mechanisms could have been put in place without the existence of a full EMS. However, they do need to be documented in some form and should clearly state the steps to be taken and any roles and responsibilities to be assumed. They also need to match the level of complexity of environmental issues relevant to the project. The output from an environmental impact assessment (EIA) that included discussion of how the projectâ€™s environmental issues, impacts and opportunities are to be managed would not be sufficient evidence to gain the credits for this requirement. Evidence is required that such EIA outputs have been translated into action."

For instance, a standing item in project progress meetings or reports, which routinely review environmental and social performance and the success of control mechanisms established, would be acceptable.

For the Contractor, it could include the incorporation of environmental mitigation actions in method statements, toolbox talks or other site briefings or inductions communicating the requirements of the SEMP, information posted via site information boards or similar. For any stage, it could also include more project workshops, such as on value management and value engineering, that includes consideration of the environmental and social impacts and opportunities on the project."
