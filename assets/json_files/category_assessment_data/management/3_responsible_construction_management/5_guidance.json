Communication should be both within the project team and externally to interested stakeholders."

      "guidance_text": "A common complaint about construction sites is that they look a mess. Materials are too often scattered all over the place along with various items of litter. Proper storage of materials can result not only in a tidier site that is visually less unpleasant but also in a safer site and can also significantly reduce wastage. Regular clearance of litter makes the site look tidier and enhances a culture of environmental care amongst staff.\n\nExample measures include appropriate site screening, allocation of stacking areas, tidy storage of materials, a regular site inspection, litter-pick and site tidy-up, and inspection and cleaning of site hoardings."
